This is a Entity / Component / Processor* library for Unity3D. If you are unfamiliar with this type of system I'd suggest the following reading:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system
http://t-machine.org/index.php/2007/09/03/entity-systems-are-the-future-of-mmog-development-part-1/

*Most literature on this topic uses the terms Entity, Component, and System. Since some of the original articles were written the usage of System has fallen out of favor somewhat due to the overloaded nature of the term and frequent naming collisions that occur. RobotArms uses the term Processor, so when reading any articles on the topic just substitute "Processor" whenever you see "System".

We were originally inspired to write RobotArms after using the Artemis framework: http://gamadu.com/artemis/
